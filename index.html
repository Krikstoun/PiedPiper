      <h1>The Problem</h1>
      <p>
        Beneath the flashy homepages of your favorite sites lurk Hooli™ and
        other evil corporations out to hoard and sell your most personal data. <br>
        <br>
        What was built to be the ultimate platform for the free sharing of
        knowledge has turned into a money-hungry monster feasting on our privacy
        and freedom. <br> 
        <br>
        But fear not, for Pied Piper has the answer! And it’s
        simple: An autonomous peer-to-peer network featuring distributed storage
        powered by universal compression, accelerated scheduling allocation, and
        end-to-end encryption. <br>
        <br>
        Put even simpler —
        <strong>it’s the internet, completely decentralized.</strong>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="hero">
      <p>
        We’re in this together! All of our computers and phones join in a
        network to make the strongest supercomputer the world has ever seen.
