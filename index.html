        <p>
          Beneath the flashy homepages of your favorite sites lurk Hooli™ and
          other evil corporations out to hoard and sell your most personal data.
          <br />
          <br />
          What was built to be the ultimate platform for the free sharing of
          knowledge has turned into a money-hungry monster feasting on our
          privacy and freedom. <br />
          <br />
          But fear not, for Pied Piper has the answer! And it’s simple: An
          autonomous peer-to-peer network featuring distributed storage powered
          by universal compression, accelerated scheduling allocation, and
          end-to-end encryption. <br />
          <br />
          Put even simpler —
          <strong>it’s the internet, completely decentralized.</strong>
        </p>

      <div class="hero">
        <p>
          We’re in this together! All of our computers and phones join in a
          network to make the strongest supercomputer the world has ever seen.
